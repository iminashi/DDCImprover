      <TextBlock Classes="Title">1. Basic Usage</TextBlock>
      <TextBlock>
        Enable the settings you want in the configuration, load some XML files and click process.
        The processed files are saved in the same directory as the original files, with a DDC_ prefix (or DD_ in case of files that already have DD).
        Opened files will be automatically reloaded if you process them again.
      </TextBlock>
      <TextBlock Classes="Title">2. Off Beat Phrases/Sections</TextBlock>
      <TextBlock TextWrapping="Wrap">
        Phrases can be moved off beat by giving the phrase a special name. Available options:
      </TextBlock>
      <TextBlock TextWrapping="Wrap">
        • "moveR#" will move the phrase right by # notes, where the number must be 1 or more. 1 will move the phrase to the next note/chord.
        Chords and split chords count as one. If the phrase c a note/chord (sustain of a previous note does not count), it counts as one.
        In the picture below "moveR3" would be the correct alternative. You should prefer this option since it is easier to use than the others.
      </TextBlock>
      <TextBlock TextWrapping="Wrap">
        • "moveto---s---": Where "---s---" is the time in seconds and milliseconds, e.g. moveto10s250, moveto150s027
      </TextBlock>
      <TextBlock TextWrapping="Wrap">
        • "moveto---m---s---": Where "---m---s---" is the time in minutes, seconds and milliseconds, e.g. moveto1m24s100
      </TextBlock>
      <Image Source="resm:DDCImprover.Avalonia.Assets.Help.moveto.png"/>
      <TextBlock TextWrapping="Wrap">
        In the above case, the phrase and section will be moved to start at 28.824 seconds (at the G power chord).
        If an FHP is set at the start of the phrase, it will be moved to the new position. The FHP at the old position is deleted if no note is there.
      </TextBlock>
      <TextBlock Classes="Title">3. Special Chord Names and Suffixes</TextBlock>
      <TextBlock>In order to use these, the "Fix Chord Names" setting must be enabled.</TextBlock>
      <TextBlock Classes="SubTitle">•	OF</TextBlock>
      <TextBlock>
        OF (One Finger / One Fret) moves the finger present in a handshape that has only one note to the specified fret number, e.g. OF5 moves it to the 5th fret. Possible use cases: tapped harmonics and artificial harmonics.
      </TextBlock>
      <Image Source="resm:DDCImprover.Avalonia.Assets.Help.OF.png"/>
      <TextBlock Classes="SubTitle">•	FIXOPEN</TextBlock>
      <TextBlock>
        FIXOPEN automates a fix for a specific case in which an open string in a chord is sustained over FHP changes.
      </TextBlock>
      <Image Source="resm:DDCImprover.Avalonia.Assets.Help.fixopen.png"/>
      <TextBlock Classes="SubTitle">•	-arp</TextBlock>
      <TextBlock>
        Changes the handshape into an arpeggio. Can be used to make arpeggios that have chords inside. Requires a relatively new version of the Toolkit to work.
      </TextBlock>
      <TextBlock Classes="SubTitle">•	-nop</TextBlock>
      <TextBlock>
        Changes the panel of a regular chord into the panel of a double stop. It is a really minor difference and mostly pointless.
      </TextBlock>
      <TextBlock Classes="Title">4. Custom Events</TextBlock>
      <TextBlock>
        You can place events in EOF by selecting a beat and pressing Shift+P. Enter the event text and check "Rocksmith event marker".
      </TextBlock>
      <TextBlock Classes="SubTitle">•so ("Slide out")</TextBlock>
      <Image Source="resm:DDCImprover.Avalonia.Assets.Help.customevent_so.png"/>
      <TextBlock>
        When placed on a chord that has an unpitched slide out, the program generates an empty handshape near the end of the slide.
        This will cause the fingers in the handshape to slide down or up with the slide. It is a minor effect that is sometimes used in oDLC.
        Note: The handshape is added only to the highest difficulty level.
      </TextBlock>
      <TextBlock>
        If the chord is on a beat you can simply use the event "so" on that beat.
        If the chord is not on a beat, you must specify the timecode of the chord in the event text in the same format as in the phrase moving, for example "so2m16s885".
      </TextBlock>
      <TextBlock Classes="SubTitle">•removebeats</TextBlock>
      <TextBlock>
        Removes the beats starting from the beat that is placed on until the end. Does not really have a practical use.
      </TextBlock>
      
      <TextBlock Classes="Title">5. XML Checking</TextBlock>
      <TextBlock>The program will check the XML for the following:</TextBlock>

      <TextBlock Classes="List">•	23rd and 24th fret notes without ignore status</TextBlock>
      <TextBlock Classes="List">•	7th fret harmonic notes with a sustain</TextBlock>
      <TextBlock Classes="List">•	Chords at the end of a handshape</TextBlock>
      <TextBlock Classes="List">•	Crowd event placement</TextBlock>
      <TextBlock Classes="List">•	Tone change placement</TextBlock>
      <TextBlock Classes="List">•	Fret/bend mismatches in LinkNext</TextBlock>
      <TextBlock Classes="List">•	Missing bend values</TextBlock>
      <TextBlock Classes="List">•	Mismatches between anchor position and chord fingering</TextBlock>
      <TextBlock Classes="List">•	Anchors (FHP) that should be on a note but are up to 5ms off</TextBlock>
      <TextBlock Classes="List">•	Notes that are set as both harmonic and pinch harmonic</TextBlock>
      <TextBlock Classes="List">•	Notes inside a noguitar phrase</TextBlock>
      <TextBlock Classes="List">•	Unpitched slide notes with LinkNext</TextBlock>
