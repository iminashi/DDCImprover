            <Paragraph>Enable the settings you want in the configuration, load some XML files and click process. The processed files are saved in the same directory as the original files, with a DDC_ prefix (or DD_ in case of files that already have DD). Opened files will be automatically reloaded if you process them again.</Paragraph>

            <Paragraph>
                Phrases can be moved off beat by giving the phrase a special name. Available options:

                        "moveR#" will move the phrase right by # notes, where the number must be 1 or more. 1 will move the phrase to the next note/chord.
                        Chords and split chords count as one. If the phrase is located on the same timecode as a note/chord (sustain of a previous note does not count), it counts as one.
                        In the picture below "moveR3" would be the correct alternative. You should prefer this option since it is easier to use than the others.

                In the above case, the phrase and section will be moved to start at 28.824 seconds (at the G power chord).
                If an FHP is set at the start of the phrase, it will be moved to the new position. The FHP at the old position is deleted if no note is there.

                When placed on a chord that has an unpitched slide out, the program generates an empty handshape near the end of the slide.
                This will cause the fingers in the handshape to slide down or up with the slide. It is a minor effect that is sometimes used in oDLC.
                Note: The handshape is added only to the highest difficulty level.

                If the chord is on a beat you can simply use the event "so" on that beat.
                If the chord is not on a beat, you must place the event on a beat left of the target chord/notes and add a number to the event name (for example "so1").
                This number specifies how many notes right of the target is from the event. It works the same as the number in "moveR" phrases.
